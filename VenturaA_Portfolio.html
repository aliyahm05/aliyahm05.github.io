        My name is Aliyah Ventura and I go to school at Inwood Early College for Health and Information Technologies. Im 14 years old and I am in 9th grade.

One short-term goal I have for myself is that I want to pass all my classes with an 85% or higher and I want to graduate early and pass all my regents. I want this for myself
because I want to get somewhere in life and I want to set an example for my younger sister and make my family proud. A long-term goal is for me to get my doctorate degree and go
to medical school.

I play volleyball, basketball and I do track. I really enjoy doing these sports because it keeps me active and I get to bond with my friends and new people. I also enjoy listening
to music because it calms me down and helps me focus. These sports helped me build teamwork and communication skills.

I was an honors student and I'm in this New-York Presbyterian hospital program that helps me develop important life skills such as leadership, problem-solving and time management.
Learning these skills are important especially for future work experiences.
